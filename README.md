# Movies-Correlation
This project is designed to analyze correlations between various variables in a movie dataset. The primary goal is to use Python to explore relationships between factors like budget, box office revenue, IMDb ratings, genres, release dates, and more. By finding correlations, we can identify patterns that may help in predicting movie success or understanding trends in the film industry.

## Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the movie dataset for analysis.
	•	Correlation Analysis: Calculating correlation coefficients between different variables.
	•	Visualization: Plotting graphs to help visualize relationships between the variables.
	•	Statistical Insights: Extracting insights from correlation results and interpreting their significance.
